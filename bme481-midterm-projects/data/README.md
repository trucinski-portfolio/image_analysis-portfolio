# Data folder

This repository contains image-analysis scripts developed for a university course.

The original image datasets used (`B6_DAPI_1.tif`, `clutter.png`, etc.) were provided as course materials from Dr. Bahram Parvin's laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, where he has permitted me to publish the images here online.
