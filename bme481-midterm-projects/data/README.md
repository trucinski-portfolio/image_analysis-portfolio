# Data folder

This repository contains image-analysis scripts developed for a university course.

The original image datasets used (e.g., `B6_DAPI_1.tif`, `clutter.png`) were provided as course materials and are not redistributed here.

To run the scripts locally, place the required images in this `data/` folder using the filenames referenced in the scripts.
